# Backtesting-IKF
Back testing for Fintech Start up I Know First Ltd

This Start up provides trading signals for different investment horizons.

I interned at this Start up in Tel Aviv, Israel during the summer of 2019.

The codes here mainly calculates the performance of the trading signals for short term forex trading.
The main strategy was to test the signals against buying and selling at different parts of the stock exchange opening hours.
The hyposthesis is to measure if open,close, perceived high and perceived low had any effect on the trading performance.
